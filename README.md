### `Project Description:`

Using React.js and the RandomUser API I was able to display a Table of 100 users allowing to filter and sort them based on the properties:Firdt Name,Last Name, Email, and Age.

The table has pagination control (10 pages) and every page contains 10 rows.

By clicking on a user image or name it opens the "User Details‚Äù page and shows the data per user, and a link to send the user a new email.
